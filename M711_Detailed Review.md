# Redragon M711 Cobra Gaming Mouse: A Detailed Review

The Redragon M711 Cobra aims to strike a compelling balance in the crowded gaming mouse arena: affordability meets performance.  Positioned as an accessible option for gamers seeking feature-rich peripherals without breaking the bank, the Cobra M711 promises customizable RGB lighting, adjustable DPI, and programmable buttons. But does it truly deliver the bite to back up its "Cobra" moniker, or is it more hiss than substance? This comprehensive review delves into the design, performance, features, and overall value of the Redragon M711 Cobra gaming mouse to determine if it’s a worthy contender for your desk space.

## Design & Build Quality: Form and Function

The M711 Cobra adopts a right-handed, ergonomic design reminiscent of the popular Razer DeathAdder [5, 8]. This familiar shape caters to a variety of grip styles, particularly palm grip for all hand sizes and claw or fingertip grips for medium to large hands [5, 7].  Its dimensions measure approximately 5.0 inches (126 mm) in length, 2.6 inches (66 mm) in width, and 1.6 inches (41 mm) in height [6], placing it firmly in the standard-size category.  Encased in a body with a soft-touch finish [6, 8], the mouse aims for comfortable extended use, though the textured ABS plastic sides, while grippy, may be prone to attracting fingerprints and dirt [1].

Build quality is generally solid, though not without minor caveats.  Some reviewers note a slight rattle when shaken and creaking under lateral pressure [1].  The PTFE mouse feet are rated as "OK" for gliding, providing a functional if not exceptional experience [9, 18]. The 1.8M braided cable, connecting via USB 2.0/3.0 [4], adds a touch of premium feel, although one review of a similar model mentions a permanent kink in the cable [19].  Internally, the M711 Cobra utilizes a Holtek HT68FB560 MCU [1], a detail perhaps more interesting to enthusiasts than the average user, but indicative of its internal components.

## Technical Performance: Under the Hood

At the heart of the Cobra M711 lies a PixArt PMW3325 optical sensor [32], capable of up to 10,000 DPI [2, 3].  DPI is adjustable in granular 100 DPI increments via software, offering significant customization [3].  The mouse provides two DPI switch modes: one with five preset levels (500/1000/2000/3000/5000 DPI) adjustable via mouse buttons, and a second mode for fine-tuning across the entire 100-10,000 DPI range in software [3].  While detailed sensor performance metrics like IPS and acceleration for the M711 Cobra specifically are less readily available [30, 31], its FPS variant, the M711-FPS, uses a PixArt PMW3360 sensor [11, 33].  The M711-FPS, in comparison tests, exhibits CPI inaccuracy, overshooting the set CPI by a noticeable margin [11].  It is reasonable to anticipate that the M711 Cobra’s PMW3325 sensor, while competent, may also exhibit some level of CPI deviation, which is common in mice at this price point.

Click latency for the M711 Cobra is not directly specified in the provided data. However, the M711-FPS, when wired, registers a click latency of approximately 11.3 ms [10, 20, 28].  While the Cobra M711 uses different internal switches than the FPS variant [1], this latency figure provides a reasonable benchmark for expected responsiveness, suggesting it should be adequate for most gaming scenarios, if not class-leading. The polling rate is adjustable, offering options of 125/250/500/1000Hz, with 500Hz as the default [3].

## Features & Functionality:  Customization Galore

The Redragon M711 Cobra is packed with features designed to appeal to gamers who like to tinker. It boasts 7 programmable buttons [2, 3], allowing for extensive customization of in-game actions and macros.  Redragon’s software, downloadable online [4], enables button remapping, macro creation (recording up to 59 actions [3]), and performance adjustments.  It also provides control over the mouse’s RGB lighting, offering 7 effects and 16.8 million customizable color options [2, 3].  Gamers who love a light show with their clicks will find plenty to play with here.  The mouse also features onboard memory, with the M711-FPS variant storing 5 profiles [23], suggesting the standard Cobra likely offers similar profile storage capabilities.

However, macOS users should note a limitation: while basic mouse functionality is fully compatible with macOS, the software for customization is Windows-only [29, 37]. This means RGB lighting and button programmability are primarily configured within Windows, though settings are generally saved to onboard memory for use across different operating systems.  It is also worth noting the scroll wheel is a standard notched wheel with 24 steps [27, 36], lacking features like tilt-click or infinite scroll found in higher-end models.

## User Experience: Comfort and Practicality

Ergonomically, the Cobra M711 aims for broad appeal with its DeathAdder-esque shape [5, 8].  User reviews for the M711 Cobra directly are limited in the provided data, but reviews for the very similar M711-FPS praise its comfortable right-handed shape [12, 13, 14, 15].  It is generally recommended for palm grip users of all hand sizes, and claw and fingertip grip users with medium to large hands [7].  The soft-touch finish contributes to a pleasant feel [6, 8], though the textured sides’ propensity to attract grime should be considered for long-term maintenance [1].

The PTFE mouse feet, while rated “OK” [9, 18], offer adequate gliding for gaming and general use.  The wired connection ensures reliable performance without battery concerns, though the cable, even braided, might present a slight drag for some users [19]. The weight of the M711 Cobra is specified at 130g [25, 34], which is heavier than many modern lightweight gaming mice. For comparison, the M711-FPS weighs approximately 100.6g [6, 21], highlighting a notable weight difference between the two models [24]. This heavier weight may be less ideal for gamers prioritizing rapid, flick-heavy movements, but provides a more substantial feel in hand for others.

## Market Comparison:  Standing in the Crowd

When placed against competitors, the Redragon M711 Cobra occupies a distinct niche: budget-friendly features.  Compared to the Razer Cobra [22, 23], a mouse sharing a similar name and shape, the Redragon M711 Cobra presents a compelling value proposition.  While the Razer Cobra boasts potentially superior sensor performance with a higher maximum speed (750 IPS vs. unknown for M711 Cobra but 250 IPS for M711-FPS) and lower weight (77g vs. 130g) [22, 23, 26], the Redragon M711 Cobra counters with a significantly lower price point [39], more onboard memory profiles (5 vs. 1) [23, 25], and more buttons (9 vs. 6) [23, 27].  The Razer Cobra, however, includes extra weights for customization [22, 27], a feature absent in the M711 Cobra.

Compared to the DELUX M800 Wireless [21], another competitor in the broader gaming mouse market, the Redragon M711-FPS (and likely the M711 Cobra) demonstrates strengths in sensor consistency and click latency [21].  However, the DELUX M800 Wireless offers the advantage of wireless connectivity and lighter weight [21], features not available in the wired-only M711 Cobra.

Ultimately, the M711 Cobra competes most directly with other budget gaming mice, offering a rich feature set, including RGB lighting, programmable buttons, and adjustable DPI, at a price that undercuts many established brands.  Its strengths lie in its customization options and comfortable, familiar shape, while its potential shortcomings include a heavier weight, a sensor that may exhibit CPI inaccuracies, and a wired-only design.

## Value Proposition: Bang for Your Buck?

Priced around $27 on platforms like eBay [39], and even lower on others, the Redragon M711 Cobra presents a strong value proposition for budget-conscious gamers.  It delivers a feature set comparable to mice at significantly higher price points, offering customizability and decent performance for everyday gaming and general use.  Areas for potential improvement include reducing weight, enhancing sensor accuracy, and potentially offering a wireless variant to broaden its appeal.  However, at its current price, the Redragon M711 Cobra offers a remarkable amount of mouse for the money.  If you’re seeking a feature-rich, customizable gaming mouse without emptying your wallet, the Cobra M711 is definitely worth considering. Just don't expect it to strike with the silent precision of a $150 serpent; this Cobra is more about a loud, colorful, and budget-friendly pounce.
